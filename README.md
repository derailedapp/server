# Derailed Server

Welcome! This is the source code and primary codebase for Derailed's API, Gateway, and other core backend services.

## Architecture

### Summary âœ¨

Derailed is split up between a Rust codebase and an Elixir codebase,
primarily belonging to the API and Gateway respectively.

While these codebases may share some code, they primarily communicate via
gRPC and so only are really directly connected with it.

### API

Derailed's API is an Axum application, and serves all non-real-time non-websocket data to users as well as in the future
being in charge of federating data to other Derailed servers.

### Gateway

Derailed's Gateway is an Erlang/Elixir application in charge of serving all real-time data, from notifications to messages and
Voice Channel speaking updates, from backend services to users.
